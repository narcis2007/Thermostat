# Thermostat
As an intern at AROBS Transilvania Software i wrote the embedded C code for a thermostat using the EFM32 Zero Gecko board and it's sensors.
The LCD display shows the current temperature and humidity as well as the desired temperature. People can change the temperature using either the physical or capacitive buttons. Once the room temperature has surpassed the desired temperature a LED light is turned on and stays like that until the room temperature is 2 degrees bellow the desired temperature. The evolution of room temperature is shown in a line graph that is updated a few times a second.
A graphical thermometer that shows the current room temperature is also displayed on the LCD.
